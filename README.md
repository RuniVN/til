# What I learnt today
Everyday I read a lot, and if i dont keep it in somewhere, this peice of knowledge will be floated and forgot. Previously, I keep them in bookmark bar. Now I think placing them to Github may be the better choice, they also need to be shared. 

Check out my issues where I will post everything there.
